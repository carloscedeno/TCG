# Frontend Reference & UI Standards

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "Geekorium Premium"
- **Aesthetics**: Dark mode by default, high contrast with vibrant accents (e.g., Electric Blue #007bff for primary actions).
- **Glassmorphism**: Use semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop-filters for modals and cards.
- **Typography**: Inter or Roboto for readability.
- **Micro-animations**: Hover states, smooth transitions for price updates, and loading skeletons.

## ⚛️ Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React with Vite.
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict mode).
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS or Tailwind (confirm with user).
- **State Management**: React Hooks (Zustand or Redux if needed).

## 🧩 Components
- Keep components small and focused.
- All UI components should be in `src/components/ui/`.
- Business components (Cards, Prices) in `src/components/features/`.
