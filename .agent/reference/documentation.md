# Documentation Standards

Guidelines for maintaining the project's knowledge base.

## 📝 Core Documents
- **`PRD.md`**: Foundational requirements. Never modify radically without alignment.
- **`PLAN.md`**: Current sprint/phase Roadmap. Update after every major task.
- **`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`**: Visual map of the filesystem.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- **Root**: High-level config and core docs.
- **`.agent/`**: AI rules and automation.
- **`docs/`**: Technical specs and legacy requirements.
- **`Documentación/`**: (To be consolidated) Business and strategy documents.

## 🛠️ Update Process
- Every time a new feature is added, update `PRD.md`.
- Every time a file is moved, update `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
- Keep technical docs in `docs/TechDocs/`.
